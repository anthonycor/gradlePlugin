## gradlePlugin

The gradlePlugin jar is a jar file containing plugins, tasks, extensions and utilities used for building the [LabKey](https://www.labkey.org)
Server application and its modules.

If building your own LabKey module, you may choose to use these plugins or not.  They bring in a lot of functionality 
but also make certain assumptions that you may not want to impose on your module.  See the 
[LabKey documentation](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=gradleModules) for more information.

linking to npm executables work when not building from source
* Update template for createModule task to parameterize version number and copyright year

### version 1.3.1
*Released*: 19 June 2018
(Earliest compatible LabKey version: 18.2)

### version 1.3
*Released*: 18 June 2018
(Earliest compatible LabKey version: 18.2)

* [Issue 34523](https://www.labkey.org/home/Developer/issues/issues-details.view?issueId=34523) - Change configuration for NPM plugin to download
specific versions of node and npm if appropriate properties are set
* Added cleanNodeModules task that will remove a project's node_modules directory
* Change JavaModule plugin to remove ```src``` as a resource directory by default.  Individual modules can declare it as a resource if needed.
* Parameterize gwt build so you can choose the target permutation browser in dev mode (using property gwtBrowser)
* [Issue 33473](https://www.labkey.org/home/Developer/issues/issues-details.view?issueId=33473) - always overwrite tomcat
lib jars to facilitate switching between newer and older versions of LabKey distributions
* [Issue 34388](https://www.labkey.org/home/Developer/issues/issues-details.view?issueId=34388) - clean out directories
created when compiling xsd's to jar file if a new jar is to be created.
* Update tasks that check version conflicts for jars and modules (no longer incubating). By default, the build will fail if version conflicts
are found.  See the documentation on [Version Conflicts in Local Builds](https://labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=gradleDepend) for more information. 
* [Issue 33858](https://www.labkey.org/home/Developer/issues/issues-details.view?issueId=33858) add checks for the 
existence of ```internal/gwtsrc``` so we can move it to its proper home in api.  
* Parameterize the location of some of the key, non-standard modules to make them easier to move around.  Parameter are ```apiProjectPath```,
```bootstrapProjectPath```, ```internalProjectPath```, ```remoteapiProjectPath```, ```schemasProjectPath```, ```coreProjectPath```.  These parameters are attached to the Gradle extension in the ```settings.gradle``` file (via the ```gradle/settings/parameters.gradle``` file).
* [Issue 33860](https://www.labkey.org/home/Developer/issues/issues-details.view?issueId=33860) - parameterization to

gradle plugins repository and modify build of plugins jar to include a zip of the moduleTemplate (that will include
the empty directories that won't migrate to git).  Actual removal of moduleTemplate will not happen until LabKey 18.3.
